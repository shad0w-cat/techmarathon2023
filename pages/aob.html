                        will have to buy 4 questions in total. Teams unable to buy 4 questions will be eliminated. The

                        completion the next member will take upon the system to complete the next question. The
                        members will not be allowed to communicate in between them and the top 3 teams to complete all
                        4 questions the fastest will win the contest.
