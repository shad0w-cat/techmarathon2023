                A minimum of 2 members will participate in the coding round and the others will be the auctioneers.
                The auctioneers and coders will be seated separately in different room where the coders will witness
                the live stream of the auction happening in the seminar hall. No contact will be allowed between the

                        Each team will be given a currency amount which they'll use to bid on coding questions. All
                        teams
                        will have to buy 4 questions in total. Teams unable to buy 4 questions will be eliminated. The
                        questions bought will be used in the second round- relay race.

                        The coders will now receive the questions. A member will start solving the question and upon
                        completion the next member will take upon the system to complete the next question. The
                        members will not be allowed to communicate in between them and the top 3 teams to complete all
                        4 questions the fastest will win the contest.
