            CONFUSED!

            WELL, here you go
            PRESENTING TO YOU: <b>"AUCTION OF BYTES"</b>
            <br />
            Test your coding skills while having some nerdy fun in the process of purchasing the questions to
            code.
            <br />
            TO BE MORE PRECISE
            Coding questions will be auctioned and the questions bought will then be solved by the teams in a
            relay race format.
            ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
            So, basically there will be a team of 3-4 members. A total of 20 teams will participate.
            A minimum of 2 members will participate in the coding round and the others will be the auctioneers.
            The auctioneers and coders will be seated separately in different room where the coders will witness
            the live stream of the auction happening in the seminar hall. No contact will be allowed between the
            two groups.
            DESCRIPTION OF EACH ROUND
            Auction
            Each team will be given a currency amount which they'll use to bid on coding questions. All teams
            will have to buy 4 questions in total. Teams unable to buy 4 questions will be eliminated. The
            questions bought will be used in the second round- relay race.
            Relay Race
            The coders will now receive the questions. A member will start solving the question and upon
            completion the next member will take upon the system to complete the next question. The
            members will not be allowed to communicate in between them and the top 3 teams to complete all
            4 questions the fastest will win the contest.
